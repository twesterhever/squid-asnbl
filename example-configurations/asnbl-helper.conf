# Logging verbosity of the asnbl-helper.py instance. Valid settings are "ERROR", "WARNING",
# "INFO" and "DEBUG", while the latter is not siutable for productive environments.
# "WARNING" will also emit ASNBL hits, which people should be generally aware of, but
# your mileage may vary.

# Set timeout for DNS queries (in seconds). If any configured ASNBL fails to respond
# to RFC 5782 (section 5) test queries within that time, it is considered to be
# unavailable. DNS query timeouts during operation will be treated as temporary network
# hiccups and result in a "warning" log message and the corresponding query being
# answered with "BH".

# Values lower than 2 seconds or greater than 20 seconds are treated as being invalid.

# Path to the socket provided by asn-lookup [.py] - Unix or UDP sockets are supported,
# start them with "unix:/" or "udp:" to make clear which protocol is being used here -
# in order to resolve IP addresses into Autonomous System Numbers. This is necessary for
# file-based ASNDBs to abstract their handling from asnbl-helper [.py]; in case of using
# a DNS-based service for resolving ASNs, leave this value blank...
